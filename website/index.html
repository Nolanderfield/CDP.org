        <p>
	    CDP or 'Community-Driven Projects' is a non-profit
	    organization that diligently seeks out sources of
	    financial aid from other organizations, companies,
	    peoples, communities, agencies, groups, governments,
	    and crowdfunding along with donations, that share
	    the same mission and vision as the CDP, to assist
	    projects that are community driven, especially
	    open-source and reverse engineering efforts.<br>
	    CDP believes lowering the needed total to fund
	    community driven projects and putting the burden on
	    it's shoulders can have a significant positive
	    impact on the technology ecosystem. The CDP
	    organization is dedicated to providing financial
	    resources and seeks to be a major source of funding
	    so that community driven projects don't have to
	    worry about financial concerns.
