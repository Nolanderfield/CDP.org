	What is CDP.org
CDP or 'Community-Driven Projects' is a non-profit organization that diligently seeks out sources of financial aid from other organizations, companies, 
peoples, communities, agencies, groups, governments, and crowdfunding along with donations, that share the same mission and vision as the CDP, to assist 
projects that are community driven, especially open-source and reverse engineering efforts.

CDP believes lowering the needed total to fund community driven projects and putting the burden on it's shoulders can have a significant positive impact on 
the technology ecosystem. The CDP organization is dedicated to providing financial resources and seeks to be a major source of funding so that community 
driven projects don't have to worry about financial concerns.

	CDP's Mission and Vision
CDP's mission is to empower projects that are community driven by providing financial resources, fostering sustainability, and encouraging innovation in 
open-source software and reverse engineering.

CDP's vision is a world where community driven technology thrives, driving innovation, privacy, and accessibility for all.
