            Thank you for showing interest, 
            here is a quick story of me and
            this website. My programming 
            journey started back in 2019,
            where I installed Debian Linux,
            an operating system, for the first
            time. I realized, then, I didn't
            know anything about how computers
            worked. The Terminal was my first
            discovery and through it the
            command-line. Linux opened my eyes!
            It was so exciting navigating the
            file system and learning BASH commands.
            I learned a lot about software and
            hardware along with a basic
            understanding of networks and how
            they function. I became aware of 
            communities that offered invaluable
            help and resources like GitHub.
            Now, I am studying Bash scripting,
            JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Networking.
            I like coding all kinds of problems
            from the very basic like adding
            numbers to the complex like
            competitive programming problems.
            I love making projects and games.
            In fact this website is one of my
            Web Development Projects which is
            built using HTML and CSS.<br>
            <br>Languages known : JavaScript,
            HTML, CSS, LINUX & BASH Scripting,
            Git, & GitHub.<br> Languages learning

            Data Structures and Algorithms, Git,
            & GitHub.
