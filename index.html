          CDP.org, or 'Community-Driven Projects', is an
          organization supporting projects driven by
          communities, especially open-source initiatives
          and reverse engineering efforts. CDP.org
          believes removing the need to fund community
          projects and putting the burden on it's
          shoulders can have a significant positive
          impact on the technology ecosystem. The CDP
          organization is dedicated to providing financial
          resources and seeks to be a source of funding so
          that community-driven projects don't have to
          worry about financial concerns.
